          <h2>Dungeon Project - Update 8: Static and Moving spikes!</h2>
          <h2 style="font-size: 15px">20 / 04 / 2016 | &beta; 0.06</h2>
          <br>
          <p>First of all - sorry for the delayed update! I couldn't manage to get the spikes to work the way which I originally intended to. Anyway, I've worked around this, so they are finally working. The static spikes weren't the problem as much as the moving ones. I assumed it would be easy to swap around tiles in the TileMap, and therefore be able to have a timer inverting it's current state, but it turns out that actually this isn't too easy (it usually would be, but I've made my TileMap slightly different) and so I had to create a new layer for each of the two current levels, which would hold the second stages of the spikes, then on the timer swap between which of these layers it renders, and in the collisions, I checked if the character was touching a spike dependant on the layer of spikes which it was actually rendering.<br>
          Anyway, if you want to download it, you can!<br><br>
          <a href="downloads/dungeon_versions/beta/dungeon_b0.06.jar" class="download">Download &beta; 0.05</a><br><br>
          Also, the next update will add monsters! Which will probably be the 'best' update yet, but also will - most likely - take quite a while to release! Hopefully it'll be worth the wait though! The next update will probably come out of beta (so, release 1! Or if you prefer, simply - '1')!
          </p>

          <h2>Dungeon Project - Update 7: More levels!</h2>
          <h2 style="font-size: 15px">16 / 04 / 2016 | &beta; 0.05</h2>
          <br>
          <img src="images/level2.PNG"><br><br>
          <p>There's not a huge amount of new features in b0.05, although the actual coding of it was among the most complicated of the updates. I needed to rewrite a large amount of code, use variables for the current level, an array for the list of levels, and many more things like that. I made a few more functions in the code to help with this, which made it a lot easier, though. Anyway, the only really noticable update is that when you get to the end of a level, it automatically takes you to the next level!<br>
          Anyway, it's finally quite close to coming out of beta, to version 1! That doesn't necessarily mean a whole load of new features, but I do have a few more things planned - not just those on the planned future features.<br><br>

          <h2>Dungeon Project - Update 6: HUD and coins!</h2>
          <h2 style="font-size: 15px">14 / 04 / 2016 | &beta; 0.04</h2>
          <p>I've fixed a bug from the last version where the health and mana potions didn't work - it was quite obvious why it didn't, so I won't go into that. I've also added (quite simple) support for multiple maps by extending Tiled's LibGDX level class to include a 2d Vector with the spawn position, and a function to change the level and put the character to the correct position. The game's becoming a bit funner to play, but it's still very easy to complete because A: there's only two levels and B: there's no monsters nor hazards.<br>If you want to download it though, click the button below!</p>
          <p><br><b>*Exciting* news:</b> I've uploaded the source code to a repository at my Github!</p>
          <a href=https://github.com/j4cobgarby/Dungeon>The repository is here!</a><br><br>
          <hr><br>
          <img src="images/hud.PNG"><br><br>
          <p>The HUD isn't complete quite yet, but at the moment it displays the player's amount of coins, their health, and their mana. I've made a different class to achieve this, although I considered writing it in the Player class. Only for b0.04, you can press K, L, N, and M to increase and reduce health and mana.<br>
          The other change in this update is that when you collects coins, the game displays this in the HUD! So I was glad that I decided to include FreeType.<br></p>

          <h2>Dungeon Project - Update 5: Keys and Keyholes!</h2>
          <h2 style="font-size: 15px">12 / 04 / 2016 | &beta; 0.03</h2>
          <br>
          <img src="images/keysdemo.JPG"><br><br>
          <p>This probably would've been released yesterday, soon after b0.02. However, I couldn't get it to stop crashing when a door was opened, as deleting the cell and then trying to render it threw a NullPointerException. An easy fix for this was to create a layer below the floor with the same texture as the actual floor, and a try-catch around the rendering. Anyway, the game is <i>almost</i> playable! Next, I'll add functionality to the exit door, work on the coins and scoring, and refine my code. As (almost) always, if you want to play it in it's current stage, the download is below!</p>

          <h2>Dungeon Project - Update 4: Collisions finally working!</h2>
          <h2 style="font-size: 15px">11/ 04 / 2016 | &beta; 0.02</h2>
          <br>
          <p>I'm not sure why this update took so long to release - mainly because there were a lot of bugs. Anyway, <b>beta 0.02 has finally been released!</b> This update doesn't add a lot (as it's based on an entire rewrite of the code). In this rewrite I completely rearranged the classes (moving level functions from Player to a new class called Level.) Also (not showing in the jar file), I've started to develop a system for keys, which will open the locks. The download's below, although it's not really the most interesting game right now.</p>

          <h2>Dungeon Project - Update 3: Collisions soon to work.</h2>
          <h2 style="font-size: 15px">08 / 04 / 2016 | &beta; 0.01</h2>
          <br>
          <p>Finally, I've almost got the collisions to work. It probably should've been a lot easier but this is my first time using tiled. This isn't a proper release, but just a post to say that the next update should be out very, very soon. Here's an image of the debug view - proof that the collisions can and will work.</p>

          <h2>Dungeon Project - Update 2</h2>
          <h2 style="font-size: 15px">05 / 04 / 2016 | &alpha; 0.04</h2><br>
          <img src="images/dungeon02.JPG" alt="Dungeon alpha0.04">
          <br><p>Here's a changelog of the latest version!</p>
          <ul>
              <li>Added <b>health bars</b>.</li>
              <li><b>Fixed some issues</b> by denying ability to resize window.</li>
              <li><b>Switched controls</b> from WASD to arrow keys movement.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>As you can see, this covers one of the plans for the game (health and mana).  Next, I'll try to add collisions with the walls, and after that probably potions. I will make a basic inventory system with space for a key of each colour - the potions will be used as and when they're collected.</p>

          <p>Above is a screenshot of the first alpha release of my dungeon game. Right now, there's not too many features - there's a moveable player character, a level to move around and a camera to follow the character.</p>
          <p>In the future, here are some things I plan to implement:</p>
          <ul>
              <li><b>Collisions</b> with dungeon walls</li>
              <li>Ability for player to <b>pickup coins</b> to gain score.</li>
